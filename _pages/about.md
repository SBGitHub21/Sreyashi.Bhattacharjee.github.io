I work on end-to-end data science projects that usually begin with collecting data from third party sources and end with delivering business insight to align with the requirements of the clients. I combine innovative skills in applied mathematics, stochastics and statistics, computer science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. I have developed a strong acumen for problem solving and enjoy story-telling with data.
